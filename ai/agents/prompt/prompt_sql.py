Q: How do I generate MySQL code to calculate the total number of coins inserted into '娱乐机' machines on February 17, 2024?
To calculate the total number of coins inserted into '娱乐机' machines on February 17, 2024, you can use the following MySQL query:
A: SELECT
    SUM(ge.CoinsNum)
FROM
    game_everydaymachineincoins ge
    LEFT JOIN game_machine gm ON ge.Machine = gm.ID
    LEFT JOIN game_machinetype gmt ON gm.GameType = gmt.ID
    LEFT JOIN mall_period mp ON ge.InPeriod = mp.ID
WHERE
    gmt.TypeName = '娱乐机'
    AND mp.ClassName = '2024-02-17';

This query first joins the game_everydaymachineincoins table with the game_machine, game_machinetype, and mall_period tables based on their respective relationships. Then, it filters the results to include only entertainment machines (TypeName = '娱乐机') and the specific date of February 17, 2024 (ClassName = '2024-02-17'). Finally, it calculates the sum of the CoinsNum column to determine the total number of coins inserted.
